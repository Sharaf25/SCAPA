# SCAPA - Smart Contract Attack Prevention Application

## Overview
SCAPA (Smart Contract Attack Prevention Application) is a **cross-platform** real-time Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to monitor and analyze network traffic for suspicious activities. It combines rule-based detection with machine learning to identify potential threats and predict attack types. SCAPA provides a modern, user-friendly interface for capturing, analyzing, and decoding network packets, making it a powerful tool for network security professionals.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Quick Installation (Recommended)

#### Method 1: Automated Installer
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sharaf25/SCAPA.git
cd SCAPA

# Run the automated installer
python3 install_fixed.py
```

#### Method 2: Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sharaf25/SCAPA.git
cd SCAPA

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r Requirements.txt

# Install PySimpleGUI from official source
pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://PySimpleGUI.net/install PySimpleGUI
```

### System Dependencies

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt-get install wireshark-common pulseaudio-utils
sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER  # For network capture permissions
```

#### macOS
```bash
# Install Wireshark from https://www.wireshark.org/
brew install wireshark
```

#### Windows
- Install Wireshark from https://www.wireshark.org/
- Ensure Wireshark is added to PATH during installation

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Running SCAPA

#### Option 1: Enhanced Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
# Run with full network capture (requires sudo on Linux/macOS)
./scapa_launcher.sh
```

#### Option 2: Direct Execution
```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Run SCAPA
python main.py
```

#### Option 3: With Elevated Privileges (Full Network Capture)
```bash
# Linux/macOS
sudo ./venv/bin/python main.py

# Windows (Run as Administrator)
python main.py
```

### Using the GUI Interface
1. **Start Network Monitoring**: Click `STARTCAP` to begin packet capture
2. **Stop Monitoring**: Click `STOPCAP` to stop packet capture
3. **Refresh Rules**: Click `REFRESH RULES` to reload detection rules
4. **Analyze Streams**: Load and analyze TCP/HTTP2 streams from files
5. **Save Data**: Export captured packets and alerts for analysis

### Network Permissions
- **Linux**: Add user to wireshark group or run with sudo
- **macOS**: May require sudo for packet capture
- **Windows**: Run as Administrator for full network access

### Customizing Rules
- Modify the `rules.txt` file to add or update detection rules.
- Rules follow this format:
  ```
  alert <protocol> <sourceIP> <sourcePort> -> <destinationIP> <destinationPort> <message>
  ```
  Example:
  ```
  alert tcp any any -> 192.168.0.0/24 80 HTTP TRAFFIC
  ```
